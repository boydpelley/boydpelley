### About me
My name is Boyd, I'm a musician and hockey player new(er!) to programming from North Sydney, Nova Scotia.
My programming interests include C, especially rendering and file manipulation, Java, JavaScript (React.js and Node.js), and web development.

I love collaborating with others so feel free to fork a repository you may be interested in working on!

I'm currently working on a retro style original game in Java - called Brewtender, currently just working on the basic mechanics at the moment but feel free to take a look!
